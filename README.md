## Overview of project
 # Key Takeaways and Learnings from the LED Blinking Code:
1. **Understanding Arduino Programming Basics**:
   - Learned how to write, upload, and debug Arduino code using the Arduino IDE.
   - Familiarized with the syntax of Arduino C/C++ (e.g., `void setup()` and `void loop()`).

2. **Working with GPIO Pins**:
   - Learned to configure GPIO pins as input or output.
   - Understood how to control digital pins using `digitalWrite()` for HIGH (ON) and LOW (OFF) states.

3. **Timing Control**:
   - Used the `delay()` function to control the time interval between LED ON and OFF states.

4. **Hardware-Software Integration**:
   - Explored connecting an external LED and a resistor to Arduino Uno's pins.
   - Gained experience in troubleshooting hardware issues like incorrect wiring.
